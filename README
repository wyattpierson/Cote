This is a template/prototype for a custom coat commerce site

It is currently incredibly sloppy, has images I don't own, and has little functionality.
The project also includes local config files that should be excluded.
This is for my own personal gain, and I will clean it up as the code reaches production level.

However my motivation has faded so who knows if that will happen...
